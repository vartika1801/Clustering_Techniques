# Clustering Techniques

This repository implements two popular clustering techniques, **K-Means Clustering** and **Hierarchical Clustering**, using the **Life Expectancy Dataset**. The objective is to analyze the dataset, cluster the data, and evaluate the clustering performance using the Silhouette Score.

# Dataset
**Life Expectancy Dataset:**
- The dataset contains data on life expectancy, various health factors, and economic indicators.
- Prior to applying clustering techniques, the dataset was pre-processed to ensure consistency and remove any potential biases.

# Pre-processing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Normalizing numerical features
- Encoding categorical variables (if any)

# Clustering Techniques
1. K-Means Clustering
- A centroid-based clustering technique that partitions the data into k clusters.
- Implementation details:
  - Optimal value of k determined using the Elbow Method.
  - Random initialization to reduce the risk of local minima.
- Evaluation:
  - Silhouette Score used to assess the quality of clusters.

2. Hierarchical Clustering
- A tree-based clustering technique that builds a hierarchy of clusters.
- Implementation details:
  - Agglomerative clustering (bottom-up approach).
  - Linkage methods (e.g., Ward's, complete, or average) tested for optimal performance.
- Evaluation:
  - Silhouette Score computed to compare cluster coherence.

## Results
- Both clustering techniques were trained on the pre-processed dataset.
- Visualizations:
  - Cluster assignments plotted using PCA or t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.
  - Dendrogram for hierarchical clustering to visualize cluster formation.

## Usage
Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Future Enhancements

- Add more clustering techniques such as DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixture Models.
- Integrate automated hyperparameter tuning.
- Compare results with alternative evaluation metrics.
